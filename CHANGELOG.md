# Changelog

One entry per release. Every merged PR is a release: it bumps `VERSION` and adds an entry here (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) › Versioning). Newest first. Component versions (`PAGE_VERSION`, helper) are noted when they change.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-11-06
Page fixes. Claude republishes existing pages on their next refresh (`PAGE_VERSION` 1.3).

### Fixed
- **B8:** one malformed link in a message threw while rendering and blanked the Messages tab and the threads in summary cards. All outside links now go through one helper that never throws.
- **Links:** only `http`/`https` links are clickable. Anything else (`javascript:`, malformed) shows as plain text. This applies to message links, the links table, deal call-outs and the old summary layout.
- **B7:** a mention of message #0 rendered without its text (`r[0]||r` treated 0 as missing).
- **B9:** with auto-posting on, the "Queued" note no longer asks you to confirm in chat.
- **G4:** the Refreshing notes no longer mention a Refresh button the page doesn't show.
- **G5:** the helper install steps name Tampermonkey (recommended) or Violentmonkey and the current Chrome "Allow User Scripts" switch, matching SKILL.md.

Components: **`PAGE_VERSION` 1.3** (was 1.2), helper 1.1 (unchanged).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-11-06
`catchup.py` fixes. No change to the page or the helper.

### Fixed
- **B11:** Messenger's own reply link to message #0 was ignored (`pi = 0` read as "no link"), so a photo reply could be linked to the author's *latest* photo instead.
- **B5:** a reply whose parent can't be found is now left unlinked (WARN), as SKILL.md always said; it used to get an automatic "answers" link.
- **B4:** a link to a parent in another conversation prints `WARN link i -> p crosses conversations`, since the page shows such a message as a new thread; an unknown link type is refused.
- **B3:** `dealEdit` on a conversation with no deal fails with a clear message instead of `IndexError`; with several deals it asks for `index`.
- **B1:** the threading note ("N reply links read straight from Messenger; …") is now written for new pages too; an older custom note is kept after it.
- **C5:** timestamps come from Python's `zoneinfo` instead of shelling out to `date`.
- **C6:** files are closed properly. The Python tests now treat ResourceWarnings as errors (1,356 warnings before, 0 after).

### Added
- `tools/release.sh`: tags the merge commit, builds the ZIP from the tag, checks its `VERSION`, and publishes the GitHub release.

Components: `PAGE_VERSION` 1.2, helper 1.1 (unchanged).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-11-06
Fixes the two P1 issues from the backlog. MINOR because the refresh procedure in SKILL.md changes (page upgrades and `restore`). Claude republishes existing pages automatically on their next refresh.

### Fixed
- **B2:** `catchup.py build` kept no backup, so a refused DB write or a corrected spec meant re-bootstrapping. Now `build` keeps the WORK it started from in `WORK/prev/`, and `catchup.py restore WORK` undoes the last build. Rebuilding a RUN without restoring says exactly that instead of `AssertionError: []`.
- **R1:** the page's database has no version-checked writes or transactions, so the importer now:
  - holds a 2-minute import lease (`refresh/importLock`), so two open copies of the page can't import at once
  - reads `meta/chat` and the newest chunk fresh from the store instead of trusting snapshots
  - **repairs a half-finished import** (chunks saved, `meta/chat` not updated) on the next paste (`REPAIRED: …`) instead of refusing every import from then on
  - refuses, with instructions, when `meta/chat` is ahead of the saved messages
  - writes nothing, not even a repair, unless the capture passes every check
- **G1 (part):** after republishing a page, set `meta/chat.pageVersion`, so it isn't republished on every run.

### Changed
- SKILL.md › Refresh steps:
  - republish the page when `meta/chat.pageVersion` is behind `PAGE_VERSION`
  - the new import messages
  - `catchup.py restore WORK` before a rebuild or after a refused write
  - two new Troubleshooting entries

### Tests
- `tests/test_catchup.py`: 7 restore tests replace the B2 known-bug test.
- `tests/page.test.js`: 17 R1 checks (half-finished import, interrupted chunk rollover, counters ahead, lease held elsewhere, stale snapshot, runtime without `acquire`). Against the v1.1.2 page they fail: it gets stuck at "The newest stored chunk doesn't end at #-1".

Components: **`PAGE_VERSION` 1.2** (was 1.1), helper 1.1 (unchanged).

## [1.1.2] - 2026-11-06
No change to the skill itself. Enforcement for the PR workflow.

### Added
- GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/test.yml`), three jobs:
  - `test` runs `npm test` on every PR and on `main`.
  - `version-bump` fails a PR whose `VERSION` isn't higher than the base branch, or is already tagged.
  - `pr-only` turns `main` red if a commit lands there without a merged PR.
- `.githooks/pre-push` blocks direct pushes to `main` from a local clone; `npm run setup` installs it (`npm run hooks`).

### Notes
- GitHub branch protection and rulesets aren't available for this private repo on the current plan (GitHub Pro required), so CI and the local hook are the enforcement (BACKLOG R8).

Components: `PAGE_VERSION` 1.1, helper 1.1 (unchanged).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-11-06
No behavior change for users. Re-upload the skill ZIP to pick up the renamed build tool.

### Changed
- Build tool renamed `scripts/cctool.py` → `scripts/catchup.py` (same commands); SKILL.md updated.
- Helper functions renamed `ccScan`/`ccVerify`/`ccCapture` → `mcScan`/`mcVerify`/`mcCapture`; page copy regenerated.
- Page accepts only the `mc-capture` kind (`cc-capture` dropped; the generic skill never produced it).
- The skill ZIP now includes `VERSION`.

### Added
- `npm test`: Python tests for `catchup.py` and the repo, the helper on a simulated Messenger (new case: a message deleted mid-run must abort), and the page in Chromium with a stand-in claude.ai runtime (full capture → import → build → render pipeline).
- `tools/sync-helper.py` (`npm run sync`) keeps the page's copies of the helper in sync.
- Release process: `VERSION`, this changelog, `CLAUDE.md`, a PR template, tags and GitHub releases.
- Handoff docs: `docs/STATUS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/BACKLOG.md`.

### Found
- B11: `catchup.py` ignores Messenger's reply link when the parent is message #0 (open, test written).

Components: `PAGE_VERSION` 1.1, helper 1.1 (unchanged).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-11-06
The generic, shareable skill as it stood before the handoff review (commits `30ad68e` … `c3186da`, tagged retroactively). History in [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) › Phase 6.

Components: `PAGE_VERSION` 1.1, helper 1.1.
