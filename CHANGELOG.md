# Changelog

One entry per release. Every merged PR is a release: it bumps `VERSION` and adds an entry here (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) › Versioning). Newest first. Component versions (`PAGE_VERSION`, helper) are noted when they change.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-11-06
No behavior change for users. Re-upload the skill ZIP to pick up the renamed build tool.

### Changed
- Build tool renamed `scripts/cctool.py` → `scripts/catchup.py` (same commands); SKILL.md updated.
- Helper functions renamed `ccScan`/`ccVerify`/`ccCapture` → `mcScan`/`mcVerify`/`mcCapture`; page copy regenerated.
- Page accepts only the `mc-capture` kind (`cc-capture` dropped; the generic skill never produced it).
- The skill ZIP now includes `VERSION`.

### Added
- `npm test`: Python tests for `catchup.py` and the repo, the helper on a simulated Messenger (new case: a message deleted mid-run must abort), and the page in Chromium with a stand-in claude.ai runtime (full capture → import → build → render pipeline).
- `tools/sync-helper.py` (`npm run sync`) keeps the page's copies of the helper in sync.
- Release process: `VERSION`, this changelog, `CLAUDE.md`, a PR template, tags and GitHub releases.
- Handoff docs: `docs/STATUS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/BACKLOG.md`.

### Found
- B11: `catchup.py` ignores Messenger's reply link when the parent is message #0 (open, test written).

Components: `PAGE_VERSION` 1.1, helper 1.1 (unchanged).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-11-06
The generic, shareable skill as it stood before the handoff review (commits `30ad68e` … `c3186da`, tagged retroactively). History in [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) › Phase 6.

Components: `PAGE_VERSION` 1.1, helper 1.1.
